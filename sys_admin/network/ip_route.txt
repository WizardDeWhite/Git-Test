1. General Concept

Current linux route strategy has two pars:

  * route rule
  * route table

First linux would match rule and then select the route table to do routing.

2. Route Rule

2.1 List Rule

$ ip rule
0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default

2.1 Add Rule

$ ip rule add from 192.168.100.212 table PrivTel

$ ip rule
0:	from all lookup local
32765:	from 192.168.100.212 lookup PrivTel
32766:	from all lookup main
32767:	from all lookup default

This rule means packet from 192.168.100.212 would select PrivTel route table
to do routing.

And you could see this rule has index higher than main/default, which
indicates this rule would be matched in advance.

3. Route Table

3.1 List Table

$ cat /etc/iproute2/rt_tables

3.2 List Table Content

$ ip route list table main

This would list the content of route table main.

3.3 Add a new Table

$ echo "101 PrivTel" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables

3.4 Adjust Specific Table Content

$ ip route add default via 192.168.0.1 dev enp0s5 table PrivTel

This would add default rule in table PrivTel.
