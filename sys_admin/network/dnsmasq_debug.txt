To debug dnsmaq we just need to enable the log and then we can see the qeury
comes.

1. Enable log

Add following two lines to /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```
log-queries
log-facility=/var/log/dnsmasq.log
```

2. Restart dnsmasq

# systemctl restart dnsmasq

3. View log

# tail -f /var/log/dnsmaq.log | grep domain-name
