1. Explanation of Output

1.1. Explanation of %Cpus

    us: Amount of time the CPU spends executing processes for people in ¡°user space.¡±
    sy: Amount of time spent running system ¡°kernel space¡± processes.
    ni: Amount of time spent executing processes with a manually set nice value.
    id: Amount of CPU idle time.
    wa: Amount of time the CPU spends waiting for I/O to complete.
    hi: Amount of time spent servicing hardware interrupts.
    si: Amount of time spent servicing software interrupts.
    st: Amount of time lost due to running virtual machines (¡°steal time¡±).

1.2. Explanation of Process List

The column headings in the process list are as follows:

    PID: Process ID.
    USER: The owner of the process.
    PR: Process priority.
    NI: The nice value of the process.
    VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by the process.
    RES: Amount of resident memory used by the process.
    SHR: Amount of shared memory used by the process.
    S: Status of the process. (See the list below for the values this field can take).
    %CPU: The share of CPU time used by the process since the last update.
    %MEM: The share of physical memory used.
    TIME+: Total CPU time used by the task in hundredths of a second.
    COMMAND: The command name or command line (name + options).

1.2.1 Explanation of S Column

The status of the process can be one of the following:

    D: Uninterruptible sleep
    R: Running
    S: Sleeping
    T: Traced (stopped)
    Z: Zombie

2. Adjust Display of top

2.1 Show absolute path of process

Press 'c'.

2.2 Change numeric unit

Press 'e' to change values in the process list: kibibytes, mebibytes,
gibibytes, tebibytes, and pebibytes.

2.3 CPU usage to ASCII graph

Press 't'.

And the three numbers from left to right are:

    * The combined us and ni percentage (user space+tasks with nonstandard nice settings).
    * The sy percentage (kernel space).
    * The total (rounded to an integer value).

2.4 Memory usage to ASCII graph

Press 'm'.

2.5 Highlight and Color

2.5.1 Color

Press 'z'.

2.5.2 Highlight running task

Press 'y'.

2.5.3 Highlight sorting column

Press 'x'.

2.5.5 Switch Highlight Font

Press 'b'.

2.6 Change the Columns Displayed

Press 'F' to enter Fields Management.

Then we can adjust the column to be displayed for process.

2.7 Alternative Display Mode

Press 'A' to display four areas.

Press 'a' to move between areas
Hint: before enable this mode, press 'z' to enable color first.

3. Sort Output

3.1 Display specific user process

top -u paras

Or

Press 'u' and input the user name.

3.2 Sort output by ... MEM for example

    * press Shift+f to enter the interactive menu
    * press the up or down arrow until the %MEM choice is highlighted
    * press s to select %MEM choice
    * press enter to save your selection
    * press q to exit the interactive menu

3.3 Shutcut for sort

    * P: The %CPU column.
    * M: The %MEM column.
    * N: The PID column.
    * T: The TIME+ column.

3.4 Only display active process

Press 'i'.

4. Operate to process

4.1 Kill a process

Press 'k', then enter the pid.
