PCI bus number adjustment. 
1. Put VF in separate bus number from the PF.
   If we put VF in the same bus as PF, they will form into the same PE.
   Since PE is the smallest element on powernv platform, this will
   introduce some problem. We can give the PF to hypervisor and VF to
   the guest.

   In current implementation, some VF will be given the same bus number
   as the PF. So we need to change the scheme in the kernel.

2. Make bus number alignment for PLX bridge.
   For PLX bridge, the secondary bus number need to be 2^N aligned. 
   While current kernel code does not meet this requirement. 
   Gavin suggest to do it in the platform related code, which means we
   need to enumarate the pci tree in platform code too. 

Resource assignment.
1. Enable the M64 bar
   Currently M64 is not enabled on powernv. So we need to enable this
   first.

2. Setup M64 bar in PCI bus/bridge
   Below is written by Gavin. 

	For particular P2P bridge, we already had all memory bars reserved now as follows.
	In order to cover the M64 bar, we have to use the prefectable (64bits) memory bar.

	BAR		Purpose
	-----------------------------------------------
	0		IO
	1		MMIO (M32)
	2		MMIO Prefect (M32)
	3		Unused

	Generally speaking, we have to set the P2P memory bars as follows and then use
	M32/M64 to cover everything we have

	BAR		Purpose			Target				M32/M64
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	0		IO			32-bits MMIO bars		M32
	1		MMIO (32)		32-bits prefetch MMIO bars	M64
	2		MMIO Prefect (M64)	64-bits MMIO bars		M64
	3		Unused			64-bits prefetch MMIO bars	M64
