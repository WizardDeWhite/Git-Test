e820 -- retrieve memory map from BIOS

# What is e820

[Definition from Wikipedia:] [1]

> e820 is shorthand to refer to the facility by which the BIOS of x86-based computer systems reports the memory map to the operating system or boot loader.
> 
> It is accessed via the int 15h call, by setting the AX register to value E820 in hexadecimal. It reports which memory address ranges are usable and which are reserved for use by the BIOS.

Let me summarize it:

This means on x86 architecture, any system what to know the memory layout, it
needs to talk to e820. Different architectures use different mechanism to
detect memory layout. For example, on ppc64, it uses device tree.

## e820 Table looks like this

If you are using linux, you could type following command in your terminal:

```bash
dmesg | grep e820

```

Then you will see:

```
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009fbff] usable
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000000009fc00-0x000000000009ffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000000f0000-0x00000000000fffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x000000003ffdffff] usable
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000003ffe0000-0x000000003fffffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000feffc000-0x00000000feffffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fffc0000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved
```

Yes, it is simple. It is just a table. And each entry represents a memory
range with start, end and type. As you can image, the data structure of the
entry is self explain.

```c
struct e820entry {
	__u64 addr;	/* start of memory segment */
	__u64 size;	/* size of memory segment */
	__u32 type;	/* type of memory segment */
} __attribute__((packed));
```


# How linux kernel utilize this

Take a look at the kernel code to see how it works~

## First, retrieve the e820 table from BIOS

The function access e820 and retrieves the memory layout is
detect_memory_e820().

```c
static int detect_memory_e820(void)
{
	int count = 0;
	struct biosregs ireg, oreg;
	struct e820entry *desc = boot_params.e820_map;
	static struct e820entry buf; /* static so it is zeroed */

	initregs(&ireg);
	ireg.ax  = 0xe820;
	ireg.cx  = sizeof buf;
	ireg.edx = SMAP;
	ireg.di  = (size_t)&buf;

	/*
	 * Note: at least one BIOS is known which assumes that the
	 * buffer pointed to by one e820 call is the same one as
	 * the previous call, and only changes modified fields.  Therefore,
	 * we use a temporary buffer and copy the results entry by entry.
	 *
	 * This routine deliberately does not try to account for
	 * ACPI 3+ extended attributes.  This is because there are
	 * BIOSes in the field which report zero for the valid bit for
	 * all ranges, and we don't currently make any use of the
	 * other attribute bits.  Revisit this if we see the extended
	 * attribute bits deployed in a meaningful way in the future.
	 */

	do {
		intcall(0x15, &ireg, &oreg);
		ireg.ebx = oreg.ebx; /* for next iteration... */

		/* BIOSes which terminate the chain with CF = 1 as opposed
		   to %ebx = 0 don't always report the SMAP signature on
		   the final, failing, probe. */
		if (oreg.eflags & X86_EFLAGS_CF)
			break;

		/* Some BIOSes stop returning SMAP in the middle of
		   the search loop.  We don't know exactly how the BIOS
		   screwed up the map at that point, we might have a
		   partial map, the full map, or complete garbage, so
		   just return failure. */
		if (oreg.eax != SMAP) {
			count = 0;
			break;
		}

		*desc++ = buf;
		count++;
	} while (ireg.ebx && count < ARRAY_SIZE(boot_params.e820_map));

	return boot_params.e820_entries = count;
}
```

The logic is also simple, it iterates on the BIOS table with int 0x15 and
stores the information to boo_params.e820_map.

## Second, store and sort e820 table to kernel area

As we can see from the previous code, the memory layout is stored in
boot_param, which is not a save place. And the raw table is not sorted. So
kernel copy the range to a save place and sorts it.

This is done is function default_machine_specific_memory_setup().

```c
char *__init default_machine_specific_memory_setup(void)
{
	char *who = "BIOS-e820";
	u32 new_nr;
	/*
	 * Try to copy the BIOS-supplied E820-map.
	 *
	 * Otherwise fake a memory map; one section from 0k->640k,
	 * the next section from 1mb->appropriate_mem_k
	 */
	new_nr = boot_params.e820_entries;
	sanitize_e820_map(boot_params.e820_map,
			ARRAY_SIZE(boot_params.e820_map),
			&new_nr);
	boot_params.e820_entries = new_nr;
	if (append_e820_map(boot_params.e820_map, boot_params.e820_entries)
	  < 0) {
		u64 mem_size;

		/* compare results from other methods and take the greater */
		if (boot_params.alt_mem_k
		    < boot_params.screen_info.ext_mem_k) {
			mem_size = boot_params.screen_info.ext_mem_k;
			who = "BIOS-88";
		} else {
			mem_size = boot_params.alt_mem_k;
			who = "BIOS-e801";
		}

		e820.nr_map = 0;
		e820_add_region(0, LOWMEMSIZE(), E820_RAM);
		e820_add_region(HIGH_MEMORY, mem_size << 10, E820_RAM);
	}

	/* In case someone cares... */
	return who;
}
```

The details are hidden in the following two functions:
1. sanitize_e820_map(), sort e820 table
2. append_e820_map(), copy e820 table in boot_param to safe place

# Take a big picture

It is time to see at which stage linux kernel accomplish the upper two tasks.

```
    /* Retrieve the e820 table from BIOS */
    main(), arch/x86/boot/main.c, called from arch/x86/boot/header.S
          detect_memory()
               detect_memory_e820(), save bios info to boot_params.e820_entries

    /* store and sort e820 table to kernel area */
    start_kernel()
          setup_arch()
               setup_memory_map(), 
                     default_machine_specific_memory_setup(), store and sort e820 table
                     e820_print_map()
```

The final function e820_print_map() is the one who print the message we
grabbed by "dmesg | grep e820". Well, that's it~

# Some important APIs

I would like to talk more about some APIs of e820, which make e820 an
infrastructure to other part of the kernel. All these functions are defined in
"arch/x86/kernel/e820.c".

## e820_add_region()/e820_remove_range()

These two functions are a pair to manipulate the e820 map. And importantly
they don't care about the order of the e820 map.

## __e820_update_range()

This one update the "type" of a memory range.

For example, from E820_RAM to E820_RESERVED.

## e820_search_gap()

This one looks for a "gap" in physical memory, which will be used in device
MMIO.

## memblock_x86_fill()

This function fill the memblock layer with e820 input. This is a very
important function which builds a generic memory management layer at the very
beginning of linux kernel boots.

We will touch the memblock in another thread.

# sanitize_e820_map()

This is a function which sorts or sanitize the original e820 map from BIOS.
And, it is interesting.


## Use two change_member to represent a e820entry

    e820entry                         change_member
    +-------------------+             +------------------------+
    |addr, size         |             |start, e820entry        |
    |                   |     ===>    +------------------------+
    |type               |             |end,   e820entry        |
    +-------------------+             +------------------------+

## Whole e820entry creates an change_member array and its pointer array

     change_member*[]                               change_member[]
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*start1                 |      ------>        |start1, entry1          |

     |*end1                   |      ------>        |end1,   entry1          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*start2                 |      ------>        |start2, entry2          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*end2                   |      ------>        |end2,   entry2          |

     |*end3                   |      ------>        |end3,   entry3          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+

     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*end4                   |      ------>        |end4,   entry4          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*start5                 |      ------>        |start5, entry5          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*end5                   |      ------>        |end5,   entry5          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*start6                 |      ------>        |start6, entry6          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+
     |*end6                   |      ------>        |end6,   entry6          |
     +------------------------+                     +------------------------+

## Sort change_member* based on the address

     change_member*[]                
     +------------------------+      
     |*start1                 |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*start2                 |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*end2                   |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*end1                   |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*start3                 |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*start4                 |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*start5                 |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*end4                   |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*end3                   |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*end5                   |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*start6                 |      
     +------------------------+      
     |*end6                   |      
     +------------------------+      

## Loop on the Sorted change_member* array

On each "start", it adds it to overlap_list[].
On each "end", it removes its "start" from overlap_list[]. 

The magic of the algorithm lies in the type of the "type".

The "current_type" is the max value in overlap_list[]. And "last_type" is the
"current_type" in last loop. When they are different, it means we face a
boundary in the e820 map. Then, start to add a new entry or set the proper
size for the previous one.
