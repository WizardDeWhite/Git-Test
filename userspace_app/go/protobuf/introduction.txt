3. Example

There is an example under the source file. The README.md has the detail

And there is an explanation document,

3.1 Define protocol buffer

The message type is defined in addressbook.proto.

3.2 Compile protocol buffer

Then use protoc to generate code for specific language.

For example, for golang, the command is:

$ protoc $PROTO_PATH --go_out=tutorial addressbook.proto

This would generate addressbook.pb.go, which would be used in go project.

3.3 Read/Write message with protocol
