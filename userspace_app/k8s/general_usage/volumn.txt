1. Volume

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes

Volume configuration would pass the directory to container in pod.

Eg:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: redis-storage
      mountPath: /data/redis
    - name: test-mount
      mountPath: /data/test
  volumes:
  - name: redis-storage
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: test-mount
    hostPath:
      path: /home/richard/minikube
```

There are several types of volume. In above example, they are

  * emptyDir
  * hostPath
