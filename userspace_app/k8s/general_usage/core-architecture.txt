1. Architecture

k8s moves up the stack giving us constructs to deal with management at the
application or service level. This gives us automation and tooling to ensure
high availability, application stack and service-wide portability.

1.1 Core K8s constructs

  * pod
  * services
  * replication controller
  * replica set
  * labels

1.1.1 Pods

Pods essentially allow you to logically group containers and pieces of our
application stack together. Pods give us a logical group of containers that we
can then replicate, schedule, and balance service endpoints across.

1.1.2 Labels

Labels acts as a selector and tells K8s which resources to work with for a
variety of operation.

1.1.3 Service / Replica

Services and replication controller/replica sets give us the ability to keep
our applications running with little interruption and graceful recovery.

1.1.3.1 Service

Service allow us to abstract access away from the consumer of our
applications. Every node runs a proxy named kube-proxy. The job of kube-proxy
is to proxy communication from a service endpoint back to the corresponding
pod that is running the actual application.

1.1.3.2 Replication Controller / Replica Set

Replica Set is a newer version of Replication Controller.
