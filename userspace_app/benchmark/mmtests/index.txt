# Simplified Call flow


  // run-mmtests.sh
  # Generate shellpack
  for TEST in $MMTESTS
      shellpack_src/src/refresh.sh $TEST
          # Generate from $TEST/$TEST- for later use
          shellpack_src/src/$TEST/$TEST-bench   -> shellpacks/shellpack-bench-$TEST
          shellpack_src/src/$TEST/$TEST-install -> shellpacks/shellpack-install-$TEST

  # Run test
  for TEST in $MMTESTS
      # Install test
      export INSTALL_ONLY=yes
      ./bin/run-single-test.sh $TEST
          . drivers/driver-$TEST.sh // define run_bench()
          run_bench()
              shellpacks/shellpack-bench-$TEST
                  shellpacks/shellpack-install-$TEST
      unset INSTALL_ONLY

      # Run test
      ./bin/run-single-test.sh $TEST
          . drivers/driver-$TEST.sh // define run_bench()
          run_bench()
              shellpacks/shellpack-bench-$TEST

# Test Cases

If my understanding is correct, you could get supported test cases from two
directories:

  shellpack_src/src/
  drivers/

## Source

If a test needs to download source and compile, it is put into

    work/source/$TEST-$VERSION-installed


# Log

mmtests provides various log infrastructure.

Usually it is put into

    work/log/$runname/iter-$i

## mmtests_activity

It logs in tests-activity
